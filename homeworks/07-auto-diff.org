Backprop algorithm and training neural networks from scratch

Like last week, the goal is to implement a stochastic gradient descent
algorithm for a neural network. Last week we used torch
to implement the backpropagation algorithm. This week we will break
the gradient computation into several different classes in order to
demonstrate how "automatic differentiation" systems like torch
work. The advantage of such systems is "separation of concerns," which
is a common theme in computer science. In this instance we separate
the gradient computations into separate classes which represent
operations for computing predictions, so that the person who writes
the fit() method of the learning algorithm just needs to compose
instances of these classes, and does not need to understand the
details of the gradient computations.

** Class: InitialNode

Each instance of this class represents an initial node in the computation
graph (not computed as a function of other nodes), with attributes
- value: numpy array representing value computed at this node (created
  at instantiation during __init__, explained below).
- grad: numpy array representing gradient of the loss with respect to
  this node (created during backward method, explained below).
- You should be able to initialize via code like

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import numpy as np
  feature_node = InitialNode(np.array([
      [1, 2],
      [2,3],
      [1,5]
  ]))
  label_node = InitialNode(np.array([[-1, 1, 2]]).T)
  weight_node = InitialNode(weight_mat)
#+END_SRC

** Class: Operation

This class represents a node in the computation graph which is
computed as a function of other nodes. This should be a virtual class,
which means it should not be instantiated directly, but instead it
should define methods that are used in subclasses.
- __init__ method should accept one or more node instances as
  arguments, then assign them to attributes based on subclass-specific
  input_names attribute (same length as expected number of arguments
  to init method). Finally call self.forward() and save result in
  value attribute.
- backward() method should begin by calling self.gradient(), resulting
  in a tuple of gradients (one for each item of input_name). Then save
  each gradient as the grad attribute of the corresponding input
  node. You can include error checking code to ensure that the shapes
  of the value and grad are the same. Finally call backward method of
  each input node, which results in a recursive call to compute
  gradients for all nodes in the computation graph.

** Classes: mm,relu,logistic_loss

- should inherit from (be subclass of) Operation.
- should define input_names attribute as a tuple of names of input
  nodes.
- forward() method should return the value computed by this operation,
  based on values in input nodes. Will be called on instantiation, and
  result saved in value attribute.
- gradient() method should return tuple of gradients, one for each
  input node. Will be called from within backward() method.
- Usage should be as below:

#+begin_src python
  a_node = mm(feature_node, weight_node)
  h_node = relu(a_node)
  loss_node = logistic_loss(a_node, label_node)
  loss_node.backward() #assigns grad attributes.
  print(weight_node.grad) #should be defined by now.
#+end_src

** Class: AutoMLP (automatic multi-layer perceptron)

This should be similar to what we did last week, except that instead
of using torch to implement the take_step method, you should use your
own automatic differentiation classes.

- __init__ method should store hyper-parameters, max_epochs,
  batch_size, step_size, and units_per_layer (list or numpy array of
  positive integers, first element should equal number of input
  features, last element should be 1). For debugging you may want to
  set units_per_layer = [n_input_features, 1] which means you will get
  a linear model and batch_size=n_rows (same as linear model
  homework). Also initialize attribute weight_node_list to a list of
  node instances, each node value should be a numpy matrix with random
  values near zero for one of the initial layer prediction functions
  in the neural network.
- get_pred_node(X=batch_features) method should 
  - begin by creating an InitialNode instance from X.
  - use a for loop over layers to compute intermediate nodes using
    Operation subclasses (mm/relu). Note that this code is defining
    both the forward and backward propagation via a computation graph,
    but the details of the gradient computations are abstracted away
    in the Operation subclasses.
  - return the node which represents the vector of predicted values.
- take_step(X=batch_features, y=batch_labels) method should
  - Make an InitialNode instance from y.
  - Use get_pred_node(X) to get a node for predicted scores.
  - Instantiate the last node in your computation graph,
    logistic_loss(pred_node, label_node), representing the mean loss to
    minimize via gradient descent.
  - call backward() on the final node instance (mean loss) to compute
    and store gradients in each node. 
  - use a for loop over nodes in weight_node_list to update each
    parameter matrix (take a step in the negative gradient direction).
- fit(X=subtrain_features, y=subtrain_labels) method should run
  gradient descent until max_epochs is reached. There should be two
  for loops, first over epochs, then over batches. You should use the
  take_step method on each batch. Compute the subtrain/validation loss
  at the end of each epoch.
- decision_function(X=test_features) method should return a numpy
  array of real number predicted scores given the current weights in
  the neural network. Hint: just call get_pred_node then return the
  value attribute.
- predict(X=test_features) method should return a numpy array of
  predicted classes given the current weights in the neural
  network. Hint: use numpy.where to threshold the return value of
  decision_function.

** Class: AutoGradLearnerCV

This class should implement hyper-parameter learning (select the
number of epochs which minimizes loss on validation set). Like the CV
class last week, this should have a fit method that splits train into
subtrain and validation sets, then runs gradient descent and computes
loss with respect to both sets at the end of each epoch.  After
learning the best number of epochs using the validation set, you
should re-run gradient descent on the entire train set using that
number of epochs.

** Hyper-parameter training and diagnostic plot

You should compute the subtrain/validation loss at the end of each
epoch.
- You should use two different models (each with a different value of
  units_per_layer), first with a linear model (no hidden layers), and
  second with a "deep" neural network (with at least two hidden
  layers).
- Run it on the full spam/zip data sets, and make a plot for each data
  set and model, of subtrain/validation loss as a function of number
  of epochs. For full credit your subtrain loss should always
  decrease, and your validation loss should show the expected U shape
  (if it does not, then you may need to change hyper-parameters). In
  each plot, what is the best number of epochs?

** Experiments/application

- Use similar experimental setup as last homework on linear models
  (with 3-fold CV train/test splits defined by KFold, and with
  GridSearchCV+KNeighborsClassifier and LogisticRegressionCV), but add
  your new algorithm to compare.
- Make sure to run experiments on both spam and zip data. This time
  make sure to scale the data sets before putting them into the
  data_dict (so you don't have to worry about scaling in neural
  network code). Show a table of resulting test accuracy numbers, as
  well as a ggplot like in last homework.
- On the ggplot y axis there should be at least the following
  algorithms: featureless, GridSearchCV+KNeighborsClassifier,
  LogisticRegressionCV, AutoGradLearnerCV_Linear (linear model),
  AutoGradLearnerCV_Deep (neural network with at least two hidden
  layers).
- Does your implementation get similar test accuracy as scikit-learn,
  or better?  (it should!)

** Extra credit

- Show your MyLogRegCV learner from week 4 on your test accuracy
  plot. How does it compare to your code this week? (it should be
  about the same)
- Show your TorchLearnerCV (deep and linear) results from last week on
  your test accuracy plot. Is it more accurate than your code this
  week, or about the same? (it should be about the same if both were
  implemented correctly)
- Implement learning an intercept for every hidden/output unit, as an
  instantiation parameter in AutoMLP(intercept=True). Show both
  intercept=True and False on your test accuracy plot: which is more
  accurate, or are they about the same? (it should be about the same,
  maybe a little more accurate with intercept)
  
** FAQ

- How to debug? For debugging you may want to set units_per_layer =
  [n_input_features, 1] which means you will get a linear model and
  batch_size=n_rows (same as linear model homework). If you use the
  same initial weights (and intercept, if present) in this week's
  code, as you used in the first linear model (week 4), and the torch
  linear model (week 6), then you should have the exact same loss,
  gradient, step, etc.
- How to make sure hyper-parameters are correctly chosen? You need to
  experiment with hyper-parameters until you find some combination
  (max_epochs, batch_size, step_size, units_per_layer) which results
  in the characteristic loss curves (subtrain almost always
  decreasing, validation U shaped as number of epochs increases).
